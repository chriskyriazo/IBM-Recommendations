# IBM Recommendations project
## Project introduction
In this project i analyzed the interaction that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and make new article recommendation they might like.<br/>
I used 3 different recommendation models that i learned through the [Udacity](https://udacity.com) Data Science Nanodegree program.
More specifically i used Rank Based Recommendations, User-User Based Collaborative Filtering and finally Matrix Factorization

## Project Tasks
> ### 1.Exploratory Data Analysis
Before building any recommendation models i need to explore the data first and see what i can find out from them with a quick look 

> ### 2.Rank Based Recommendations
This task is finding out what are the most popular articles based solely on interactions as a factor.<br />
These are the articles often recommended to new users.

> ### 3.User-User Based Recommendations
This is a method of recommendation taking into account 'similar' users based on the articles they have interacted with.<br />
I found users with a large number of similar articles they have interacted with and based on them, I recommend the user any of the articles that they interacted with, but he didn't.

> ### 4.Matrix Factorization
This is a machine learning based method that uses a matrix composed by users and their article interactions(user-item matrix).
