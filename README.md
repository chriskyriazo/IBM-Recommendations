# IBM Recommendations project
## Project introduction
In this project i analyzed the interaction that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and make new article recommendation they might like.<br/>
I used 3 different recommendation models that i learned through the [Udacity](https://udacity.com) Data Science Nanodegree program.
More specifically i used Rank Based Recommendations, User-User Based Collaborative Filtering and finally Matrix Factorization
